Quick-Start Guide
Run this app on your iPhone (need to be open minded about using a terminal)

## 1. Get the project onto your computer

- Create a free GitHub account (if you don’t have one).

- Click the green Code button → HTTPS → Copy.

## 2. On your computer:

- Open the folder where you keep projects  

- Paste the line you copied after the word “git clone” like this

`git clone <paste-the-address-here>
cd <project-folder>`

## 3. Install the tools (one-time) and set up the app

`npm install`

> Trouble running npm install?
> Make sure you installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (which includes npm) and then restart your terminal window.

## 4. Run it on an iPhone
- Use your real device. Install the free “Expo Go” app from the App Store on your phone.

- Back on your computer, start the project:

`expo start`

In your teminal you should be able to see a QR code. 

- Open camera → point the camera at QR code. The app loads on your phone. Success ✨

## 5. What about Android? 🤖
In theory you can also open the app the same way with the expo go app
…but I haven’t tested Android, so no promises — use at your own risk!

## 6. Stop the app
In the terminal where expo start is running, press Ctrl + C.

## If all of that is too much (understandable) enjoy a video of the functionality:
